> baas keeou beekhian so baht kay aasay he aasay s bais bithaaeiou

He spends his life in sinful tasks and sits and ideals away his life in meaningless pursuits. 

> saach keho suun laeho sabhay, jin praem keeo tin hee prabh paaeyo

I speak the truth, listen everyone: Only the one who is absorbed in True Love shall attain the Lord.
