### Dhanaasree Mehlaa:4

> Ichhaa poorak sarab sukh-daata har jaa kai vas hai kaamdhaynaa.

God is the fulfiller of desires and the giver of total peace. Under Godâ€™s power is the mythical wish-fulfilling Goddess.

> So aisaa har Dhi-aa-ee-ai mayray jee-arhay taa sarab sukh paavahi mayray manaa.

Meditate on God, Oh my soul. Then you shall obtain total peace, Oh my mind. 

> Jap man sat naam sadaa sat naam.

Chant Sat Nam, Oh my mind. Ever chant Sat Nam.

> Halat palat mukh oojal ho-ee hai nit Dhi-aa-ee-ai har purakh niranjanaa. Rahaa-o.

In this world and the world beyond your face shall become radiant by continually meditating on The Immaculate Lord. 

> Jah har simran bha-i-aa tah upaadh gat keenee vadbhaagee har japnaa.

Wherever God is remembered in meditation, misfortune disappears. By great good fortune we meditate on God.

> Jan naanak ka-o gur ih mat deenee jap har bhavjal tarnaa.

Nanak has been blessed with this understanding; by meditating on God, we cross the turbulent world ocean.
