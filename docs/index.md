The Lord of foursome quarters, Gladsome in every state,

> Suyanbhav subhan sarb-da sarb jugte.

Self-luminous and auspicious, Affine to one and all,

> Dukalan pranasi dialan sarupe.

Erasing virulent time, Embodiment of Compassion,

> Sada ang sange abhangan bibhute.


The Ever-so-near Companion, The Grace that vanishes never.
