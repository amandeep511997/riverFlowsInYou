### Raag Ramkali(sung at dawn), Dasam Granth, Patshahi:10

![guru-gobind-singh-ji](/assets/images/guru-gobind-singh-ji-6.jpg)

> Ray man eh bidh jog kamaa-o

O mind! practice renunciation in this way:

> Singee saach akapat kanthalaa

Let Truth be your horn, sincerity your necklace,

> Dhi-aan Bibhoot charaa-o 

and meditation the ashes you apply on your body.

> Taatee geho aatam bas kar kee 

Catch your burning soul (self) and stop the flames.

> Bhicchhaa naam adhaarang

Let the soul (self) be the alms bowl in which you collect the sweet Naam and this will be the only support you will ever need.

> Baajay param taar tat har ko 

The Universe plays its divine music. The sound of reality is shrill, but this is where God is.

> Upajai raag rasaarang 

When you listen to the reality from this place of awareness the sweet essence of Raag arises.

> Ughatai taan tarang rang 

Waves of melodies, emotions, and passions arise and flow through you.

> Gi-aan geet bandhaanang 

Bind yourself with the song of God.

> Chak chak rehay dayv daanav mun 

The Universe spins like a potter’s wheel and from it fly demons and angels.

> Chhak chhak bayom bivaanang 

The sage listens to this and instead of getting caught in either one, the sage drinks the nectar of the heavens and is carried to the heavens in a divine chariot.

> Aatam upadays bhays sanjam ko 

Instruct and clothe yourself with self control. Meditate unto infinity

> Jaap so ajapaa jaapai 

until you are meditating without meditating.

> Sadaa rehai kanchan see kaayaa 

In this way, your body shall remain forever golden,

> Kaal na kabahoo bayaapai 

and death shall never approach you.


*Raag Ramkali – The emotions in Ramkali are like those of a wise teacher disciplining their student. The student is aware of the pain of learning, but is still conscious of the fact that ultimately it is for the best. In this way Ramkali conveys the change from all that we are familiar with, to something we are certain will be better.[(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragas_in_the_Guru_Granth_Sahib)*

*Raag Siree (ਸਿਰੀ ਰਾਗੁ) – The basis of this Raag is steeped in the traditions of mainstream Indian Classical music. Siri Raag is serious and thought provoking in its nature and creates an atmosphere where the listener is led to heed the advice given therein. The listener (the mind) is made aware of the truth of the message and with this ‘education’ is given the strength to face the future with both humility and the ‘gained’ knowledge.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragas_in_the_Guru_Granth_Sahib)*
